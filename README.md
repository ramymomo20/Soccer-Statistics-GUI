All credit for the use of this API goes to reppon97 and FBREF.

I contributed by updating the web scraping code that has been changed on the FBREF website. I also added new soccer leagues and with that new functions in aid of outputting those leagues. With that, I wanted to give credits to those two as they aided heavily in this project.

 View league tables and their top scores from the Top 9 best leagues in Europe using a GUI program.
